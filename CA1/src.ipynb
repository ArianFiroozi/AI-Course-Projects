    "    For generating a new population, first `carry_pool` is created. This list contains a number of best chromosomes that will be carried to next generation without crossover or mutation. Then the next population will be generated by creating mating and crossover pools, then pool will be combined with carry pool and lastly, some chromosomes will be mutated to create new generation.\n",

    "    Mating pool is generated by `create_mating_pool` method using random selection. Biased random selection for mating pool has been tested, but considering that a carried pool would already be added to the pool, it proved to not be useful because of the nature of curve fitting problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crossover\n",
    "    Crossover pool is generated by `create_crossover_pool` method by first implementing crossover on mating pool and then cutting off the lowest fit chromosomes to fit the size of population. This included earlier generation to get best results from both populations at first, but as the carry system is implemented it no longer needs the previous population since best chromosomes will be carried to the population anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutate\n",
    "    Mutation pool is generated by `create_mutate_pool` method which uses a biased random mutation. Individuals are selected randomly, but genes mutate in a biased random method which mutates lower-degree coefficients more often than higher-degree ones. Since high degree coefficients play a greater role in determining fitness function and tend to converge earlier than other coefficents and almost in all scenarios mutating these genes produces worse results (especially when algorithm runs on functions of degree 5 or higher). Please note that mutating rate is 50% in test runs but that doesn't mean genes mutate too much as explained above. Here is a plotted comparison between biased and random mutation:"

    "## 6. Questions\n",
    "1. If the population is too large it can slow the algorithm down since time complexity is not linear, while a significantly small population may fail to find the answer since the diversity of the chromosome pool is not enough.\n",
    "2. If the previous population remains, each generation population will grow exponentially and after a few generations, the algorithm will require large memory resources and will be extremely slow. If not all previous generation remains, it can be handled in lower generation cycles, however, it could be troublesome as the generation cycles increase.\n",
    "3. Crossover can help obtain new chromosomes that combine best traits of their parents, while mutation can generate better or worse chromosomes. Some of these **better** chromosomes can be vital to finding the answer since not all problems have greedy answers. Using only crossover can lead to getting stuck in local optimums while relying only on mutation for making better chromosomes will randomize the algorithm, ultimately defeating the purpose of genetic algorithm.\n",
    "4. We can use multi-objective optimization method. A multistart method can also be implemented to avoid local optimums.\n",
    "5. Lack of diversity can lead to getting stuck in local optimums. Increasing the mutation rate and avoiding selection of same parents for new chromosomes can solve this problem.\n",
    "6. Using limited cycles of generation (which this algorithm already does), or setting a runtime limit for the algorithm.\n",
    "7. Generally, higher-degree problems tend to be harder to solve since the size of chromosomes will increase and time complexity is usually n^2 or higher.\n",
    "8. More information about the curve helps to find a certain curve more easily and it will increase search time. Fewer points in space can define more than one curve which is typically easier to solve and may give us multiple answers. "
